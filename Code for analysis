# Download sample-metadata file from - https://data.qiime2.org/2017.8/tutorials/atacama-soils/sample_metadata.tsv into current working directory
# The sequencing type is "paired-end-sequencing" hence we will have to download the forward and reverse sequencing read
# Download forward sequencing reads from - https://data.qiime2.org/2017.8/tutorials/atacama-soils/10p/forward.fastq.gz, save as "forward.fastaq.gz"
# Download the reverse sequencing reads from - https://data.qiime2.org/2017.8/tutorials/atacama-soils/10p/reverse.fastq.gz, save as "reverse.fastaq.gz"
# Download the barcodes file for the sequencing from -  https://data.qiime2.org/2017.8/tutorials/atacama-soils/10p/barcodes.fastq.gz, save as "barcodes.fastaq.gz"
