#Downloading data files

# Download sample-metadata file from - https://data.qiime2.org/2017.8/tutorials/atacama-soils/sample_metadata.tsv into current working directory
# The sequencing type is "paired-end-sequencing" hence we will have to download the forward and reverse sequencing read
# make a directory called sequences to store all the sequences and barcode you will download below

mkdir sequences

# Download forward sequencing reads from - https://data.qiime2.org/2017.8/tutorials/atacama-soils/10p/forward.fastq.gz, save as "forward.fastaq.gz"
# Download the reverse sequencing reads from - https://data.qiime2.org/2017.8/tutorials/atacama-soils/10p/reverse.fastq.gz, save as "reverse.fastaq.gz"
# Download the barcodes file for the sequencing from -  https://data.qiime2.org/2017.8/tutorials/atacama-soils/10p/barcodes.fastq.gz, save as "barcodes.fastaq.gz"

# Demultiplexing - we will demultiplex the sequence.qza files to identify sequence reads associated with each sample. For this we will utilize the sample-metadata file which has information on the barcode associated with a particular sample
# Within the sample metadata file the barcodes are present in a column called "BarcodeSequence"
# --p-reve-comp-mapping-barcodes indicates that the barcode reads are the reverse complement of what is listed on the sample-metadata file
